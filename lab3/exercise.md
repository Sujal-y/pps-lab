Lab Exercise
Write C programs to do the following with the help of two iterative (looping) control
structures: while and do-while statements
1. Reverse a given number and check if it is a palindrome or not. (use while loop).
[Ex: 1234, reverse=4*10 3 +3 * 10 2 + 2 * 10 1 + 1 * 10 0 =4321]
2. Generate prime numbers between 2 given limits. (use while loop)
3. Check if the sum of the cubes of all digits of an inputted number equals the number
itself (Armstrong Number). (use while loop)
4. Write a program using do-while loop to read the numbers until 1 is encountered.
Also count the number of prime numbers and composite numbers entered by user.
[Hint: 1 is neither prime nor composite]

Additional Exercise
1. Check whether the given number is strong or not.
[Hint: Positive number whose sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the
number itself] Ex: 145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 is a strong
number.
2. Write a program to demonstrate use of break and continue statements in while and
do-while loops.
