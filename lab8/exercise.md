Lab Exercise 
With the knowledge of modularization, function definition, function call and recursions,
write C programs which implement simple functions.
1. Write a function Fact to find the factorial of a given number. Using this function,
compute NCR in the main function. N!/(R!*(N-R)!)
2. Write a function CornerSum which takes as a parameter, no. of rows and no. of col
umns of a matrix and returns the sum of the elements in the four corners of the matrix.
Write a main function to test the function.
3. Write a recursive function, GCD to find the GCD of two numbers. Write a main pro
gram which reads 2 numbers and finds the GCD of the numbers using the specified
function. Ex: GCD of 9, 24 is 3.
4. Write a recursive function FIB to generate nth Fibonacci term. Write a main program
to print first N Fibonacci terms using function FIB.
[Hint: Fibonacci series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...]

Additional Exercise
1. Write a function IsPrime to check whether the given number is prime or not.
Using this function, generate first N prime numbers in the main function.
2. Write a function array, sum to find the sum of 'n' numbers in an array. Write a
main program to read 'n' numbers and use array, sum function to find the sum of
'n' numbers.
3. Write a function Largest to find the maximum of a given list of numbers. Also
write a main program to read N numbers and find the largest among them using
this function.
4. Write a function toggle to toggle the case of each character in a sentence. Write a
main program to read a sentence and use toggle function to change the case of each
character in the given sentence.
5. Write a function IsPalin to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.
Write a main function to test this function.
Write a program to multiply two numbers using a recursive function. [Hint: Mul
tiplication using repeated addition]
