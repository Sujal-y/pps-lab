Lab Exercise 
With the knowledge of 1D arrays, write C programs to do the following: 
1. Find the largest and smallest element in a 1D array. 
2. Arrange the given elements in a 1D array in ascending and descending order using 
bubble sort method. [Hint: use switch case (as case ‘a’ and case ‘d’) to specify the 
order]. 
3. Print all the prime numbers in a given 1D array. 
4. Search the position of the number that is entered by the user and delete that particular 
number from the array and display the resultant array elements

Cumulative Lab Programs: Towards Application Development 
5. Define a 1D array called STUDENTS of size N, which holds the roll numbers of N 
students, display the roll numbers, search for a given roll number and display appro- 
priate message. 
STUDENTS 
1 2 3 4 5 6 ... N 
6. Define a 1D array called MARKS of size N, that holds the marks of N students, sort 
the marks in descending order and display the resultant array. 
MARKS  
23 79 68 93 37 89 ... N

Additional Exercise 
Write C programs to do the following: 
1. Insert an element into a 1D array, by getting an element and the position from the 
user. 
2. Search an element in a 1D array using linear search. 
3. Delete all the occurrences of the element present in the array which is inputted by 
the user. 
4. To enter number of digits and create a number using this digit. 
[Hint: Enter number of digits: 3, Enter units’ place digit: 1, Enter tens place digit: 2, 
Enter hundreds place digit: 5; The number is 521]
