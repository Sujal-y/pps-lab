Lab Exercise 
With the knowledge of 2D arrays, write C programs to do the following:
1. Check whether the matrix is symmetric or not
2. Compute and display the trace and norm of a given square matrix.
Hint: Trace sum of principal diagonal elements, Norm= SQRT (sum of squares of
the individual elements of an array)
3. Perform matrix multiplication and display the resultant matrix.
4. Interchange any two Rows & Columns in the given matrix and display resultant.
Additional Exercise
1. To interchange the primary and secondary diagonal elements in the given Matrix.
2. Search for an element in a given matrix and count the number of its occurrences.
3. Compute the row sum and column sum of a given matrix.
4. Check whether the given matrix is magic square or not.
5. Check whether the given matrix is a Lower triangular matrix or not.
Ex: 1 0 0
    2 3 0
    4 5 6
