Lab Exercise
With the help of for loop statements, write C programs to do the following
1. Generate the multiplication table for 'n' numbers up to 'k terms (using nested for
loops).
[ Hint: 1 2 3 4 5 ….	k 
2 4 6 8 10 ….2*k 
..………………..… n……………… n*k ] 
2. Generate Floyd's triangle using natural numbers tor a given limit N. (using for
loops) [Hint: Floyd's triangle is a right angled-triangle using the natural numbers]
Ex: Input: N=
Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
3. Evaluate the sin(x)= x- x3/3! + x5/5!–x7/7!+ ……… to n terms
4.Check whether a given number is perfect or not. 
[Hint: Sum of all positive divisors of a given number excluding the given number is equal to the number] Ex: 28 = 1+ 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 is a perfect number

Additional Exercise 
1. Find out the generic root of any number. 
[Hint: Generic root is the sum of digits of a number until a single digit is obtained.] Ex: Generic root of 456 is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 = 1+5 = 6
2.Write a program to demonstrate use of break and continue statements in for loop.
